# io-home-server
Automated setup for my home server, Io.


There are three sections to this repo, each with their own READMEs'.

## Install
This section is intended to capture everything up to the point that there is
a computer, configured to act as a server, with an operating system installed.

## Base provisioning
This section will capture everthing required at runtime for my personal server setup, including services, containerisation, and routing.

## Dev provisioning
This will capture everything to install beyond the base server, required for further development. None of this should be required at run-time.
