There are two sections to this repo with their own READMEs'.

## Install
This section is intended to capture everything up to the point that there is
a computer, configured to act as a server, with an operating system installed.

## Provisioning
This section will capture everything required at runtime, from apps to drivers.

### Desktop provisioning
This will capture everything to install for an interactive desktop environment, including dependecies required for further development of this repo.

### Server provisioning
This will capture anything required for my lightweight always-on server, including containerisation and routing.
